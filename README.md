# Task 6: Linear Regression – House Price Prediction

## Objective
To build a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using the California housing dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
California Housing Dataset

## Model Evaluation
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error) was used to measure average prediction error.
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) was used to measure overall model accuracy.

## Visualization
A Predicted vs Actual scatter plot was created to visually evaluate model performance.

## Outcome
The model was able to predict house prices reasonably well and helped understand regression evaluation metrics.
